\usage{
cleanScore(HWsheet, key, skip = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{HWsheet}{the output of function \code{readScore}}

\item{key}{the output of function \code{convertKey}}

\item{skip}{a vector of integers to solve the problem like HW1 Question1}
}
\value{
a list of four objects: a data frame of scores,
a vector of numbers of response for each question,
a vector of full points for each question,
a data frame of answers.
}
\description{
Match the answer key question names with the data files.
If there are multiple attempts, the attempt with the highest
score is kept. If some questions in the data files are not
needed for analysis and not provided in the answer key, then
we use argument \code{skip} to skip them.
