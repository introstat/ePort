Topic 08: Summarizing the Least Squares Regression Line

After studying this topic, students should be able to:
 
A. Interpret the slope of the regression line in the context of the data.
B. Interpret the intercept of the regression line in the context of the data.
C. Determine when the interpretation of an intercept is reasonable given the context of the data.
D. Calculate predictions and residuals for points using the regression line.
E. Determine, given the context of the data, when it is appropriate to make predictions using the regression line.
F. Interpret a residual plot and determine what it indicates about the fit of the regression line.
G. Interpret the R-squared value for the regression line in the context of the data.
H. Describe the relationship and the difference between the correlation coefficient, r, and R-squared.
I. Identify unusual points and their effect on the regression line.
