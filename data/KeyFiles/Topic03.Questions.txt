A sample of 120 amplifiers is tested for gain.

T03.M.V.03-1.1.MC.amps 
A telecommunications equipment manufacturer was getting complaints about low volume on long distance calls. Amplifiers are used to boost the signal at various points in the long distance lines. The boosting ability of the amplifiers is called gain. Amplifiers are designed to have a gain of 10 decibels (dB). This means that a 1 dB input signal would be boosted to a 10 dB output signal. A sample of 120 amplifiers is tested for gain.
