Topic 06: Normal Distribution

After studying this topic, students should be able to:

A. Use standardizing to determine how many standard deviations an observation is away from the mean value.
B. Use z-scores to compare observations for different quantitative variables. 
C. Explain how standardizing affects the shape, center, and variability of the distribution of a quantitative variable. 
D. Determine which quantitative variables could be modeled using the normal distribution by interpreting graphical representations of the variable.
E. Apply the 68-95-99.7 Rule to any quantitative variable with a normal distribution.
F. Find percentile or area values for any given observation from a normal distribution.
G. Find the value of an observation when given a percentile or area value from the normal distribution.
